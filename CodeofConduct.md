# Principles of Urban Science 2020 Code of Conduct


**Diversity is a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually. 
Thank you for making this space harassment free and inclusive to all members of this class environment**
. If you have concerns, if you do not feel safe or are made to feel unwelcome in this class, 
please come talk to me. If you feel targeted, come talk to me. 
If you see instances of ill-natured interactions please come talk to me. 
Keep in mind that I am a mandatory reporter according to 
[Title IX](https://sites.udel.edu/sexualmisconduct/how-to-report/guidelines-for-reporting/), so if you report to me instances of discrimination and harassment I have to report the complaint to the UDel administration. However, there are many additional resources, inculding confidential resource at UDel if you wish to employ independent reporting channels; 
please see [this list of resources](UDelResources.md). 

The following Code of Conduct applies to all interactions of members of MLTSA (PHYS 667), online and offline,
including social media, mailing lists, forums, meetings, conferences, and one-to-one interactions.

- All members of the group should be treated with respect regardless of personal attributes, 
including but not limited to: race, ethniticity, gender or gender identity, physical appearence, 
phyiscal abilities, religious believes, political affiliation or opinions, sexual preference, 
caregiver status, age, nationality, language. 

- Harrasment, verbal or physical, are not tolerated. 
Keep in mind that what is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another.  

- Bullying, including physical bullying, exclusion, marginalization, disparagement, or intimidation, 
is not tolerated. 

- All members of the group are empowered to request that an undesirable behavior is dismissed. 
 
- All members are expected to immediately stop any behavior inconsistent with the Code of Conduct 
regardless of original intent.


This Code of Conduct supplements, and does not overwrite, 
the Codes of Conduct that you are bind to in your role at UDel. 
For example [here is the UDel students' CoC](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/18-19/code.html)
 
 **Microaggressions**

We all come from different places and have different level and kind of privilege, and oppression. 

Because of this it is impossible to completely understand another person's vulnerabilities.

This leads to microaggressions: ways in which we perpetrate oppressions in subtile, often unintentional ways. 

An example of a microaggression, one that was exposed in the UD students's letter to the administration, may be to ask an asian student to adopt a western name with an easier pronunciation. The person that ask likely does not realize tht this imposes the concept that there is a "norm" that is europocentric and white.

I am a white middle-class-raised, middle-class woman. In that I have a lot of privilege. If with my privilege I mess up and "committ" a microaggression, *_please call me out on it_*! You can turn on your microphone and say "ouch" if you are comfortable to do it in front of the class. Or you can talk to me personally after class. If class members do it let them know in the same way. Ask me if you want my intervention if you prefer not doing it directly.

If someone points out that you something you "said" or "did" is a microaggression don't be defensive! Listen and commit to understand. There should be no assumption that you had malignant intensions. This way we can move forward and grow together.

## Group Interactions and meeting conduct:

I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all of my students to assure we maintain and foster 
a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. This includes:  

- Be mindful of cultural norms. Make sure you know how your classmates want to be addressed 
(e.g. ask their preferred pronoun; mine is she/her/hers). 

- Do not interrupt your teammates while they are speaking, do not speak over teammates and be aware 
and respectful of the natural volume of their voice. 
Be respectful of individual communication skills and fluency in the common languages we speak. 
 
- Be available, within reason, to share knowledge and do so respectfully. 
Never make a teammate feel bad for not knowing something you already know. 
It is not your role to assess your teammates' efforts or knowledge. 
If you feel like supporting a teammate is getting in the way of your productivity 
in the group bring this concern to me directly.
