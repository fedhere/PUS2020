# Assigned Reading

[What is the Question](http://fbb.space/PUS2020/reading/The%20Research%20Question-2015-Leek-1314-5.pdf) By Jeff LEek and Roger Peng. 
This paper argues that a common mistake in data science is to rush conclusions that are simply not supported by the kind of analysis that was performed. 
Note the flowchart of the data analysis in the second page and try to remember the phases of the analysis and their order.

# Assignment 1 (and only)


You are encouraged to work in groups!! I advise you look for partners to work with on slack. If you need help finding a partner let me know.

Remember to add a README.md to your github repository folger 2 that states

1 - what the homework was about in your own words

2 - who you worked with

3 - what things were you responsible 

Each student should turn in a notebook of their own. The notbeooks do not need to look different. The README should be individual and be done by yourself


Follow instructions in the [skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUS2020_FBianco/blob/master/HW2/PhillyParks_instructions.ipynb) 

You can open the notebook or create a new notebook and copy the content of the cells where needed. 

Rememeber that each quesition should be answered and each figure should have a caption that discusses: what is shown, and why (i.e. what is noticeable about what is shown).

Help yourself with the resources in the classdemos, in the [PandasCh7.ipynb](https://github.com/fedhere/PUS2020_FBianco/blob/master/HW2/PandasCh7.ipynb) notebook in this folder, and in the python bootcamp https://github.com/fedhere/PyBOOT
