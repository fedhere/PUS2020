SPPA667: GENERATING AND INTERPRETING EVIDENCE FOR EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS



**Grades are based on:**

- 15% pre-class questions
- 15% labs performance and participation
- **20% homework**
- 20% midterm (project proposal)
- 30% Ô¨Ånal (project)


Welcome to Machine Learning for Time Series Analysis class, a class developed and taught by Federica Bianco at the University of Delaware Physics and Astronomy Departmant : PHY 667

**This class has a [Code of Conduct](CodeofConduct.md) Before you do any thing else, please review the code of conduct. If you have questions of concerns about it let me know promptly**

Please review the [Syllabus](http://bit.ly/PUS2020syllabus)


**Course Description** This course will teach you the basis of data driven research on urban environments. 
You will acquire basic computational skills, basic knowledge of statistical analysis including traditional methods and machine learning, error analysis, good practises for handling data and big-data, and communication and visualization skills. _After this class you should be able to formulate a question relevant to Urban Science, findan appropriate data to answer the question, prepare and analyze the data, get an answer, to whichever confidence level, and communicate your answer, and your confidence level in the answer._

This is an interdisciplinary class that combines technical and domain skills. Don't worry about how much you already know, especially do not compare it to what other students know: all skills and perspectives will come together to solve problems. 

The course will be organized in a modular fashion, with some guest lectures. 
	


# GRADING GUIDELINES

Each HW must be turned in as a directory in PUS2020_<FirstInitial><LastName>.
  
The directory HW<hw_number> **must have a README.md which lists who was in the group that the student worked in and states the student's participation. Missing the README will result in a 0 grade**. No penalty if the student declares not to have had any specific contribution but to have just followed and learned. However missing the README.md, missing the statement about who the student worked with and what they did, or inconsistencies between the statements of students within the group that cannot be easily reconciled by asking will costs them 10% of the grade.

Each HW (except when otherwise stated) should deliver a jupyter notebook, written in python and developed (or tested) on google colab. The notebook needs to containsections on:

- code to collect data

- code to explore the statistical properties of the data

- code to answer a specific question about the data as assigned by me

- text formulating and writing code to answer a different question of your choosing

- code to visualize the results and communicate each result

 The grade will be based on the rendered plots and on the comments to the statistical results.
 
**Plots**: Each assignment turned in as a notebook must have rendered plots with axis labels and captions. Each **missing/non rendered plot, or plot without axes labels or caption will not be counted**. The caption should state *What* is being plotted (describe the plot) and *Why* it is being plotted (describe the conclusions that the reader should draw from the plot).

**Model and statistical analysis results must be discussed**. It is not sufficient to run a test and print the test output without commenting on the meaning of the test and results. The student should discuss why a test is chose, what the result is, what are the weaknesses of the test.

**The notebook must be executables**: I must be able to run the notebook on google colab and get the exact same outputs. If data are used they must be available, ideally by loading them online, so that I dont need to download large datasets (more details on this will be given in each homework set). The student should use conventional libraries, the use of any unusual library should be justified, and indicated explicitly in the readme, along with links to obtain the library if not available by conda, pip, port, or brew install. Turning in a notebook that cannot be executed will cost 10% of the grade. I will randomely select two notebooks each week to test if they run.

If code is used from other resources, e.g. copying a function found online, the resource must be stated, as a citation, in the notebook. Plagiarism is not allowed (obviously) and severely punished by UD. Instances of plagiarism will cost the entire homework grade, and may cost failing the class, and may cause expulsion from the program!

Adherence to coding style (PEP8, see this markdown) is encouraged in the first half of the semester, without being penalized. In the second half of the semester (starting with the midterm) not adhearing to the PEP8 guidelines will cost 5% of the grade per infraction (per type of infraction).

Ultimately the homework are for the student to learn, and the test of your learning is in the Midterm and Final, where the student has to work independently generating an analsyis plan and a result. Working in groups is encouraged in the homework preciselly so that students can support each other and learn from eachother taking advantage of the complementary skills they have. Understand the homework, so that you learn. Go over the homework solution and the TA corrections.
The homework is due by Monday at noon. For homework turned in through github this means we will only review material uploaded by the deadline. A single 3-day (72 hours) exception is allowed throughout the semester, explicitly declare that you are going to use it when you do not turn in the homework, and do use it wisely (if you still do not turn in the homework at the end of the 72 hours your extension will still be available for you to use). The lowest grade in the first half of the course (before midterm), and the lowest grade in the second half will be disregarded in computing the final grade. If you fail to turn in an assignment that will be a 0, and the lowest grade. This means you will lose the chance to disregard your worst performance. Homework will be exclusively received through github (unless otherwise stated). The homeworks assignments are downloaded automatically at due time, so there will be no ambiguity as of whether the homework will be turned in time.
