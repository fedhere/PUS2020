# Fit lines to data
Use data from the electoral precincts in Delaware and see if there is a linear proportionality between voter turnout and population. If the relation is linear thats means that there is the same turnout in all districts. IF it is not what does it mean?
Follow the notebook and accomplish all tasks. There are also extra credit tasks if you choose to do them. 
Remember that 
- each plot needs axis labels and a caption to discus what it means: what is plotted and what is noticeable. 
- each model should be discussed: discuss the mathematical and contextual merits of the model 

All tasks are done (for different data) in the notebooks we explored in class and discussed in the slides (or else the code is ready for you to plug in data if they were not explicitly discussed)
